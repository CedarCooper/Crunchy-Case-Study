# Case Study: Will Today’s Market Allow For Our Company to Increase Dog Food Prices in 2024?

## Introduction:

In this scenario I am working with a fictional dog food production company named Crunchy. Crunchy is a small company that has been in production since 2016 and has not increased their prices since launch. 

They rode out peak pandemic and have been having a harder time staying afloat with their bargain prices. They want to launch a new marketing campaign to reach first time customers, but before they invite all the new business, they want to know if they can increase prices. 

They are aware their current churn rate may increase, but their campaign is to play a commercial on the 2024 Puppy Bowl. Per 2023’s record breaking 13.2 million viewers and being aired on Animal Planet, TBS, Discovery Channel, Discovery+, and HBO Max - Crunchy is confident new time customers will outweigh current clientele. 

My job is to provide them with the data that will either give them confidence on their price changes or lead them to hold off another year. 


### Deliverables:

A presentation including data viz about U.S. trends and my recommendations.
